# Basic Architecture of System Design

## Introduction
System design is a critical aspect of software engineering that involves defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. The goal is to create a blueprint for the system that addresses both functional and non-functional requirements.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Architectural Patterns
- **Monolithic Architecture**: A single unified unit where all components are interconnected and interdependent.
- **Microservices Architecture**: A collection of loosely coupled services that communicate over a network, allowing for independent deployment and scaling.
- **Serverless Architecture**: A cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of machine resources.

### 2. Components of System Design
- **Frontend**: The user interface and user experience components that interact with the user.
- **Backend**: The server-side logic, database interactions, and application programming interfaces (APIs).
- **Database**: The storage system for data, which can be relational (SQL) or non-relational (NoSQL).

### 3. Design Principles
- **Scalability**: The ability of a system to handle increased load without compromising performance.
- **Reliability**: Ensuring the system is consistently operational and available.
- **Maintainability**: The ease with which a system can be updated or modified.

## Conclusion
Understanding the basic architecture of system design is essential for building robust, scalable, and maintainable systems. This document serves as a foundational guide for further exploration into specific architectural patterns and design principles.
