## 🧐 About
This repository is a personal study log I maintain during my military service (2025).  
It focuses on three pillars:

- **AI Research** → Reading, summarizing, and implementing papers.  
- **English Study** → Vocabulary, expressions, and reading practice.  
- **Coding Practice** → Algorithms, Python exercises, and toy projects.
